As of now the peec overlay repository has moved from Github to Codeberg.

Those who started using peec's Gentoo overlay before the migration will
need to re-add the repository to receive new updates.

For '/etc/portage/repos.conf'
=============================
Simply change the 'sync-uri' field to the url below.

https://codeberg.org/subDIMENSION/gentoo-overlay.git

You may need to manually delete the repository and re-sync.

For 'eselect repository'
========================
1. Remove the overlay via

> eselect repository remove -f peec

2. then re-add the overlay via

> eselect repository add peec git https://codeberg.org/subDIMENSION/gentoo-overlay.git
